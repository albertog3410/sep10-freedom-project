This chip can be placed not only in a GPU, but also in the register of a hard drive based on the size you purchase it in.

                <div class="message-body">When inserting this chip, you would have to select what type of project you are going to do.  This way, the chip can match the amount of Ghz needed for the project.This chip can be placed not only in a GPU, but also in the register of a hard drive based on the size you purchase it in.To make sure that no internet connection interferes with the computer and chip, the chip can be stored in the data of the cache memory.Inputting this to cache memory makes sure that the next time you use the chip, it saves the amount of Ghz that was used when you inserted the chip in your project.

                    If you are doing a simple project that requires 1 Ghz, the P.G.U changes the amount of Ghz 1.
                    Even if your processor is using too much Ghz, the P.G.U can also store the amount of Ghz to its storage and decrease it to the ideal amount of Ghz.
                     Or if you are rendering a 3D image, the chip can also change the amount of Ghz to 3.5.
                    So say you want to process a 3D model and your computer needs a higher Ghz, and your processor does not have that capability, the P.G.U can increase the Ghz on your computer to the ideal amount it needs for the project.
