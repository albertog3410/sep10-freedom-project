# Presenting Freedom Project Website
##### 5/20/2025

### Where I am at Now
This week, me and my class are getting ready to prepare and present our Freedom Project Website in an expo that takes place in the lunchroom. Before we presented our projects, each of us prepared by presenting our projects to the entire classroom. Before presenting, I created a plan of how I was going to present my website in my <a href="https://github.com/albertog3410/sep10-freedom-project/blob/main/prep/presentation.md">presentation.md</a>. I presented this through a series of slides that explained:

* What my website was about
* How I made my website
* Overview about the topic I researched
* How I got my information
* What I learned from this project




  ### Classroom Presentation Experience
   I did not have enough time to present all of the ideas that I wanted to say when it was my turn to present due to me starting near the end of class. Being that the classroom was a larger environment, I felt more nervous than what I was when at the expo. However, I as I spoke I ignored the time and said what came to my mind. After my presentation, I did notice others presentations and based off what they said, I took notes on what I could do later on when I presented my project to the expo as well as a rough draft of my elevator pitch in my <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1A2XHHZMAQzeLSCWgqWkjUZEGnJgxERoBWS8t-Opy4gI/edit?tab=t.0">SEP 10 Notes.</a>. 
  
### Expo Presentation Experience 
I felt a little bit more comfortable presenting at the expo because there were not many people that decided to look at my project. I was also more comfortable because I was presenting to students that were my age as well as some who are below my grade. The only really intense part of presenting at the expo was when the judges came to look at my project, being that they were juniors and seniors.


### Skills That I learned 
At first, I was having trouble figuring out what to put on my slides that would align with what I wanted to talk about. But as I looked through my presentation.md, I made sure not to focus too much on colors and style and did my best to include the images and text that best represent what I will be talking about when I present my project to the class. Even though I did not have enough time to fully complete <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1k4kwkzc9YKW5hxpw8--_Bp2bct3xF3-JllOVe0DIR84/edit?slide=id.g358e36cd9e1_0_6#slide=id.g358e36cd9e1_0_6">my slides</a>, I did well in showing my ideas through the slides that I have created. From this experience, I learned how to effectively <strong> break down my tasks</strong> and <strong>develop my communication skills</strong> in not just the project, but also an internship that I have attended throughout the course of making my freedom project. 




### EDP 
I am currently on the last step of the Engineering Design Process, which is to <strong>Communicate the results</strong> of my website to my classmates as well as the people who are present in the expo.

### Takeaways
Even though I was nervous when I first heard that I would present towards a bigger group, it has helped me come out of my shell and start talking more in class even when I am not doing presentations. I even got to meet new people in my class that I soon became good friends with as we explored different ways to do our own projects. Overall, despite this year long project being hard to complete, I enjoyed exploring a career about something that I do not know much about and using it to create my Freedom Project Website!
