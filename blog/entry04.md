# Deciding on Tools 
##### 2/24/2025

## Where I am at Now
So far, I had already decided to use a tool known as <a href="https://bulma.io/">Bulma.io</a> when I start my SEP10 Freedom Project. I tinkered with Bulma.io in my IDE's HTML and CSS files and at the same time, had a preview link of what the website would of looked like on the side. There were many options and elements that this tool provided, I have watched a couple of videos that broke down the basics of using Bulma.io so I will know where I can start. Two videos that I used for my tinkering are from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCSAExGFK1E&t=245s"> Net Ninja</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-oOdhS4Fc4">SteffOverflow</a>. I also taken notes on the different elements that Bulma.io offers so that I could use them later on. Some code that I saved for later use are: 

Menus:

```
<p class="menu-label">General</p>
       <ul class="menu-list">
```

Dropdown button with content, can be used for anchor links. 

```
<div class="dropdown is-active">
  <div class="dropdown-trigger">
    <button class="button" aria-haspopup="true" aria-controls="dropdown-menu2">
      <span>Content</span>
      <span class="icon is-small">
        <i class="fas fa-angle-down" aria-hidden="true"></i>
      </span>
    </button>
  </div>
  <div class="dropdown-menu" id="dropdown-menu2" role="menu">
    <div class="dropdown-content">
      <div class="dropdown-item">
        <p>
          You can insert <strong>any type of content</strong> within the
          dropdown menu.
        </p>
      </div>
      <hr class="dropdown-divider" />
      <div class="dropdown-item">
        <p>You simply need to use a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> instead.</p>
      </div>
      <hr class="dropdown-divider" />
      <a href="#" class="dropdown-item"> This is a link </a>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

Using all that I have been able to comprehend from these videos, I created a website about what Github is that incoporates Bulma.io styling and columns. Even though I did not finish it, it was good for me to learn how to use Bulma.io myself in HTML and CSS. I was not able to completly work with Bulma.io, but having enough time to explore its features has gave me an idea of what to expect. 


### EDP
Although we do not yet know how to set the Freedom Project website, we are currently at step 5 of the <strong>EDP(Engineering Design Process)</strong>. In this step, I am tinkering with my tool(Bulma.io) so that I will know how to use it for when I truly start designing my Freedom Project website.


## Skills I learned 
At first it was really overwhelming when tinkering with Bulma.io because of the many elements and uses it had to offer and I did not know where to start. That was when Mr.Mueller told me to watch tutorial videos on Youtube to help me understand how to use my chosen tool. Watching these videos has really helped me narrow down my options on what I can have time to use and what may not be important for when I create my website about Graphic Design. From this I learned how to <strong> effectively manage my time</strong> and <strong> how to comprehend new material</strong>, helping me learn more about Bulma.io.

### Final Thoughts
Despite not having all the time to review all of the Bulma.io features, I am glad enough to be able to experiment with it and see how I may use it when I do my Freedom Project Website!
