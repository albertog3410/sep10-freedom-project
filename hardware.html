        <p>Processors</p>
      </div>

      <p>Processors/CPUs  are an important component of a computer that performs most of the processing inside the computer.
        A processor has four components:
        <ul>
       <li> A floating point unit (FPU):  This component carries out floating point numbers, such as square root, multiplication, division, subtraction, and addition.</li>
        <li>An arithmetic logic unit (ALU): What performs the calculations, arithmetic and logic operations.</li>
        <li> Registers: This component manages the data inside of a computer and tells the ALU what processes must be performed.</li>
         <li>Cache Memories: This component stores copies of data from the frequently used main locations.  </li>
        </ul>
