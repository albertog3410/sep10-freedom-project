# Tinker With Tool
##### 4/11/2025

### Where I am at Now 

For the past weeks, I have been pracitcing learn my tool that I will use in my Freedom Project Website. The website that I will be using for my website is known as <a href="https://bulma.io/">Bulma.io</a>, a modern CSS framework that has similar components to <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/getting-started/introduction/">Bootstrap</a>. As I practiced with Bulma.io, there were many components I have tinkered with such as <strong> Columns, Menu, and Breadcrumb</strong>. In the time that I had to tinker with Bulma, I did not get to everything I wanted to practice using, but that was okay because I have already learned enough of bulma to actually make a website.


### How I Tinkered

Getting to understand Bulma was not easy, escpially being that I barely have time at home to practice it myself. 





What really helped me in my learning was taking multiple notes in my learning log, so that I can remember what components I used and how to use those components. 




### Skills that I have Learned
