### Where I am at Now
<p>  So far, I just started looking up the different types of <strong>Softwares and Hardwares</strong> that are used in Graphic Design. This information will be used when creating our year-long project in the Software Engineering Program. </p>

###  Graphic Design Software And How I got it

<p> To get the information for Graphic Design Software, I first looked up <i>Apps for Graphic Design.</i> I eventually found a website known as

[rmcad.edu](https://www.rmcad.edu/blog/premier-graphic-design-software-15-top-tools/#). As I was browsing through this website, I found helpful information about the Software Graphic Designers use. Some of the Softwares that I found were </p>
* <strong>Affinity Designer,</strong> which is a software that specializes in vector graphics and photo editing functionalities, similar to Adobe Illustrator. Using this software would be more ideal because it is cheaper to get and provides the latest software updates. Which makes Affinity Designer a more accessible and practical software.
*  <strong>Krita</strong>, a software mainly used by artists, illustrators, and designers because of its reliability when it comes to  painting tools, customizable interface, and support for animation.
*  <strong>SVG-Edit</strong>, which is commonly used for editing scalable vector graphics (SVG) files. This program also provides users effective editing in their designs. Making it a quick and easy software for creating and editing tasks. Each of these apps can serve different purposes in Graphic Design such as UI and UX design, websites and/or apps.
  <p> When it comes to the type of Software Graphic Designers use, it depends on what is needed for the project. There are many lesser known softwares that may be more effective and accessible than popular choices such as <strong>Adobe Illustrator and Sketch.</strong> During my search, I found more examples of these types of softwares on a website called, 

[cyberlink.com](https://www.cyberlink.com/blog/photo-editing-best-software/1359/best-graphic-design-software). In this website, I found a software known as <strong> PhotoDirector.</strong> This app allows users to combine elements from different images, making an image more creative and unique. It is bested suited for beginners because of how simple it is to use as well as being able to use professional graphic design tools.</p>
    
  ### Graphic Design Hardware And How I got it 
<p>When I first started researching Graphic Design hardware, I looked up, <i> Graphic Design tools.</i>  This did not find a lot of good options that I could put in my project, it was mainly giving me information about how to become a Graphic Designer and its software. Instead, I changed my search to <i>Graphic Design hardware that is not programmed</i> to be more specfic. From this, I was able to find the information I need and grown in the skill of <strong>Learning how to google.</strong> </p>
