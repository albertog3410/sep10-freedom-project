# Ideas for Future Graphic Design Innovations
##### 12/18/2024

### Where I am at Now
In my SEP10 freedom project, I had to come up with an idea of an invention that may exist in the future of the technological world of Graphic Design. I am currently at stage 3 of the Engineering Design Process, which is to <strong>brainstorm possible solutions.</strong> I may not be really creating this invention in the real world, but I have been able to research problems about certain software and hardware that I indicated in my plan. So far, I have already came up with a possible innovation that may exist in the future which I called <strong>P.G.U (Persona Gigahertz Unit).</strong> 

### Information about P.G.U
The P.G.U is a special type of chip that you can apply to a GPU(Graphic processing unit) so that it can maintain its Memory clock speed. When inserting this chip, you would have to select what type of project you are going to do. This way, the chip can match the amount of Ghz needed for the project. Maintaining a good memory clock speed ensures that your designs will be shown in the best possible way.   

### How I Got the Information
When first starting this part of my freedom project, I had no idea of how I was going to come up with my own tech based invention because I was not a professional in the topic that I choose. So I asked my teacher, Mr.Mueller about what could be a possible design idea for Graphic Desigers. He said to look over my notes and see what do the softwares and hardwares that I researched does not have. When I looked over my notes, I eventually realized that it takes a good <strong>Memory clock speed</strong> to be able to use the software best suited for your needs. Memory clock speed is what determines how well the graphics cardâ€™s can access and transfer data stored in the video memory quickly. For example, having a high memory clock speed <a href="https://www.electronicshub.org/core-clock-vs-memory-clock/#:~:text=Ans%3A%20For%20most%20modern%20graphics,to%202000%20MHz%20or%20higher">can improve performance, especially in tasks that heavily rely on accessing and manipulating large amounts of data stored in the video memory</a>. However, having a high memory clock speed can also cause more problems in the computer such as overheating and waste battery faster. With this in mind, I decided to talk about how my innovation can manage the memory clock speed effectively without it going too high or too low. 

### Skills I Learned
From this experience, I learned how to <strong>develop my creativity</strong> in my year-long project as I was able to envision a possible way to keep the quality of graphics stable when Graphic Designers are on softwares that may require high memory clock speed. As well as paying <strong>Attention to detail</strong> when realizing what can be improved about the softwares and hardwares used in Graphic Design. 

### Final Thoughts 
Overall, I am excited to see how I can use the information I gathered now into a full website!
