##### 10/7/2024

## How I choose this topic
The topic that I have chosen to work on for this project is Graphic Design because this topic has been something that I have been truly passionate about reseacrhing. I have developed a desire to explore this topic for a couple years now and it has come to my attention that using creativity and applying it to the world of graphic design has been a career that I would like to delve deeper into as this profession was important throughout history as it is today in the technological world. I have consider other topics to research on, such as media production and fine arts, but graphic design has been the topic that intrigued me the most.
