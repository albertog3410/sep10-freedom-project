# Presentation Plan

## Hook
* Ask audience: How do you imagine someone who is a Graphic Designer? (wait for at least 2 seconds)
* 
* Explain that Graphic Designers are more than what people realize, instance there are graphic designers for novels you may enjoy, advertizements you see online, or even as little as the design house accessories

## Product
* Present my website to audience and give overview for what the website talks about.
* Explain that the website talks more about:
  * The history of graphic design.
  * Features software and hardwares that most graphic designers use today
  * Presents my own idea of a possible Graphic Design innovation for the future.


## Process
#### Steps On How I gathered Information
1. Mention how I looked up reliable sources that I used in my project(using websites that end in .edu and .gov)
2. Looking up software and hardware that people may not know much about and talk about it.
  
*  Trying to find a common issue amongst graphic designers and trying to find a possible solution with the information I got from my reliable sources.

####  Present How I Learned my Tool
* Present Bulma.io, An Aframe that adds new components and style options to your website.
* Weeks of learning my tools through videos, website page, and tinkering with components myself.
* Present challenges I had with tinkering with Bulma.io(Root it with Last Takeaway) 
#### Wireframes
* Present wireframe website 
* Explain what wirefreame website is used for
* Show how I used it as a reference when making my website. 



## Conclusion
* Present URL To Project
*  Takeaways
   * Be Original: Don't try and do a certain tool because everyone else is.
   * Ask For Help When Needed: If you have a question about something, try asking for help on it. It is okay to be confused about something. As humans, it takes time for our brains to process new information, so having someone who is experienced with this information is helpful in learning.
   * Leave audience with a Thought: Try and Think about the stuff you do in your life? What may the things you do have an affect on your friends, family, jobs, etc?
   

<!-- EXAMPLE

## Hook
* Verbal riddle of GGD

## Product
* GIF/Demo of example/non-example

## Process
* Flowchart of plan
  * MVP: noun -> door -> yes/no
  * Beyond MVP: noun -> word relation API -> noun API -> yes/no, with counterexample
* Code snippets of:
  * MVP
  * Both APIs
  * Challenge with API keys

## Conclusion
* [URL to project]
* Takeaways
  * Less = more: the heart of the riddle was one line of code; it obviously took more to make the entire thing work, but one complicated line of regular expressions was essentially the solution to the riddle
  * Expect the unexpected: it’s important to budget time for things you don’t account for; for example, I didn’t consider the fact that I would need another entire API to detect nouns
  * Determination is key: ironically enough, I had to make my API keys private. At first, it didn’t seem like it was possible, which meant I couldn’t publish my app. But after all of that hard work, I was determined to find a solution, and I found it in config variables.
* "Presentation can’t, but a speech can"
