# Deciding on Project: Entry #1 (Graphic Design)
##### 10/7/2024

## How I choose this topic
The topic that I have chosen to work on for this project is Graphic Design because this topic has been something that I have been truly passionate about reseacrhing. I have developed a desire to explore this topic for a couple years now and it has come to my attention that using creativity and applying it to the world of graphic design has been a career that I would like to delve deeper into as this profession was important throughout history as it is today in the technological world. I have consider other topics to research on, such as media production and fine arts, but graphic design has been the topic that intrigued me the most. Some of the websites that I will use to get the information that I will need for my project are [The U.S Bureau Labor of Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/arts-and-design/graphic-designers.htm#tab-4) a website from the United States Governemtn that gives specific information about certain jobs and occupations that I would like to pursue when I grow older. As well as(The Official Careers Website of the City of New York)[https://cityjobs.nyc.gov/job/graphic-designer-in-queens-jid-14841] which talks about the requirements for any jobs or careers. 
## Engineering Design Process
I am currently on the first stage of the Engineering Design Process, which is to define the problem. Currently, we did not have the time to research any known problems relating to Graphic Design. However, I have seen online that there is a massive need for Graphic Designers in the UK, so I have a problem that I could start out with once I start on the project. After this, we will then do more research about the topic we are passionate about and research about how our topic is related to technology.
## Skills
